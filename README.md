# The Passive Edification Screen - Codename: Audrey

![Action Shot](/images/thequote.png)

This is a script that uses similar smarts to the [crypto ticker](https://github.com/llvllch/btcticker), but to display randomly-chosen highly-rated **quotes** from Reddit (r/quotes), a **word of the day** or a item from a **flashcard** text file (selected at random, according to weightings in config file `config.yaml`)

# Getting started
## Prerequisites

(These instructions assume that your Raspberry Pi is already connected to the Internet, happily running `pip` and has `python3` installed)

If you are running the Pi headless, connect to your Raspberry Pi using `ssh`.

Install the Waveshare Python module following the instructions on their Wiki under the tab Hardware/Software setup.

(To install the waveshare_epd python module, you need to run the setup file in their repository - also, be sure **not** to install Jetson libraries on a Pi)

```
cd e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## Install & Run

Copy the files from this repository onto the Pi, or clone using:

```cd ~
git clone https://github.com/llvllch/edify.git
cd edify
```

Install the required modules using pip:

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

If you'd like the script to persist once you close the session, use screen.

Start a screen session:

```screen bash```

Run the script using:

```python3 edify.py```

Detatch from the screen session using CTRL-A followed by CTRL-D

The unit will now pull data every 60 minutes and update the display.

# Troubleshooting

Some people have had errors on a clean install of Rasbian Lite on Pi. If you do, run:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
```

and re-run the script.

If the unit is freezing, try switching to another power supply. I've lost count of the number of times I've spent half a day trying to debug what turned out to be a dodgy power supply.
